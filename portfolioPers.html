            <h2 id="hf">Helfyre</h2>
            <p>My first project is Helfyre, a dungeon-crawler video game in which the player explores an eight-part labyrinth, using various tools to fight their way through the underworld, slaying monsters and defeating bosses to unlock the gates and challenge the final boss. The purpose of Helfyre is to entertain the player with intense action, puzzle solving, and inventory management. HelFyre is currently a conceptual game, and is planned to be in development by early 2024. I selected this example because I feel that the game is a fun idea and a good example of my creativity.</p>

            <p>My second project is Dominion, a fighting game where players cast spells against each other to win. The attacks are pulled from a complex element system, with each element having nine spell variations, and each character having 2 elements and 4 spell slots. The purpose of this game is to entertain players with in-depth “rock-paper-scissors”-esq gameplay, a dark, cool aesthetic, and intense action. Dominion is currently a conceptual game, and is planned to be in development by early 2024. I selected this example because I feel that the element system present in the game is a good example of my technical proficiency.</p>
