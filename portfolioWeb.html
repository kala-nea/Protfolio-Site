                        <p class="pad">My first project was the CSS Zen Garden. In this project, we were tasked to build an aesthetically pleasing website using only css, no javascript, given an html base. We had to use styling methods such as incredibly specific selectors to design the site&apos;s layout. I learned how to properly utilize selectors such as :root, and :nth-of-type. One of the challenges I faced when completing this project was including all of the selector types that were required, as I was unfamiliar with most of them and was unsure of how to implement them. In response to this, I collaborated with others to discover inventive ways to use the unknown selectors and investigated their capabilities to properly implement them in ways that I would not have otherwise. <a href="https://unique-lily-1ab700.netlify.app/" target="_blank">Check it out here</a></p>

                        <p class="pad">My second project was a budget calculator. In this project, we were tasked with building a functional site that would take the salary of a job and calculate all taxes taken from the salary, subtract them to find a final salary, and assist in calculating additional expenses. I learned how to implement 2d arrays with a list of jobs and their respective salaries. One of the challenges I faced was placing all of the preset jobs into the code, as at the start of the project I was unsure of how to use arrays to their fullest. In response to this, I collaborated with others to gather inspiration for select chunks of code, and investigated and reflected upon my experimentation in a classmate&apos;s code. <a href="https://lucky-nougat-034470.netlify.app/" target="_blank">Check it out here</a></p>

                        <p class="pad">My third project was an informational site on yellow journalism. In this project, we were tasked with building a full website dedicated to a presentation for a social issue, but we couldn&apos;t work on it; we had to tell others what to do. I learned how to effectively communicate my vision to whichever classmate was working on the site. One of the challenges I faced was communicating how I envisioned a specialized 3-column layout to be made. In response to this, I initiated an investigation in nesting sections in a way that would allow the creation of 3 columns. <a href="https://capable-tartufo-a02a52.netlify.app/" target="_blank">Check it out here</a></p>

                        <p class="pad">My fourth project was a web game called Scalawag Seas. For this project, I partnered with 2 classmates and we were tasked with building an online version of a physical board game, but with a choice. I learned how to utilize local storage in passing variables between pages, as well as how to work with classes in javascript and animations in css. One of the challenges I faced was creating a ship creation page, as I had to adapt the game we were using as a basis to work with ships and write javascript capable of creating any combination of weight class, weaponry, and armor distribution. In response to this, I collaborated with my partners and investigated methods of completing the task at hand. <a href="scalawag-seas.nelify.app" target="_blank">Check it out here</a></p>
