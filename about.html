The app had to be modular, as the game and thus the criteria which needed to be scouted changes each year. I also had to learn Svelte for these projects, as the app had to be made so that it would not require wifi. <a href="https://stablescout2023.netlify.app" target="_blank">Check it out here</a></p>
