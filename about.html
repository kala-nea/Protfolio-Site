            <h4>Leadership on FRC Team 6305 Stable Circuits - Head of Scouting</h4>
            <p>As Head of Scouting, I developed an app for taking data on other teams during competition matches. The app had to be modular, as the game and thus the criteria which needed to be scouted changes each year. I also had to learn Svelte for these projects, as the app had to be made so that it would not require wifi.</p>
