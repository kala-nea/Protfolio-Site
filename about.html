            <h4>Leadership on FRC Team 6305 Stable Circuits - Head of Scouting</h4>
            <p>As Head of Scouting, I developed an app for taking data on other teams during competition matches. The app had to be modular, as the game and thus the criteria which needed to be scouted changes each year. I also had to learn Svelte for these projects, as the app had to be made so that it would not require wifi.</p>

                <!-- 0b doesn't have an & character :( -->
                <p>In my free time, I like to enage in mental challenges and help others in their endeavors. Currently, I do this by playing board and table-top games such as BattleTech, and participating in STEM-related events such as FIRST Robotics Competition.</p>

                <!-- Battletech -->
                <h4>BattleTech</h4>
                <p>BattleTech is a table-top wargame in which players pilot &apos;Mechs (short for BattleMech) against each other, and the last player standing wins. Games are split into rounds, with rounds split into three phases in which players roll for initiative, move their &apos;Mechs, and fire their weapons.</p>

                <p>FIRST (For the Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology) Robotics Competition, or FRC for short, is a global high school sport in which teams build a robot to complete tasks given in the form of a game, then compete in weekly events. Teams play on alliances with two other teams, which can change throughout the event. At the end of each event, the top eight teams chose alliance partners to compete for a chance to go to the World Championship.</p>

                <p>I plan to spend my first two years at Clovis Community College to complete my general education, as I can save a lot of money on tuition fees through them, and I will be close enough to my home and high school that I will not have to worry about housing and I can continue to serve on my robotics team as a mentor.</p>
