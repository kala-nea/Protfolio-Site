            <h2 id="ccr">Career of Choice Research Essay</h2>
            <p>My first writing project is Career of Choice Research Essay, an informational essay on the career of Visual Effects Artistry. It is a research essay describing the specifics of the job, such as salary, outlook, and environment. The purpose of the essay is to inform the reader of the career and potentially present it as an option for them. I selected this sample to share because I feel that this is the best, most recent example of my informational writing proficiency.</p>

            <p>My second writing project is an excerpt from Gemstone Legacy, an unfinished novel that I had planned to write. It is a personal creative work inspired by various shows, books, and other entertainment that I enjoy. The purpose of the book was to entertain with action and comedy. I selected this sample because I feel that it is the current best example of my narrative writing proficiency.</p>
